            Week & Contents  \\ \hline  
            Week 2 & Week 2 is for deciding the project to work for the next 3 terms. I read all the project descriptions in detail. Then noted projects numbers which I am interested in. After, I listed projects which I am interested in. I checked the requirements for projects. Some projects required specific languages. Therefore, my ability is not fit with most of the requirements, I unlisted that projects. Through this process, I got my favorite 10 projects. Then I wrote reason to choose projects. I gave higher priority to projects which are easy to explain why I am interested. I completed a list of favorite projects. However, 10 projects are too much, so I randomly picked the last 2 projects. The future plan is after I am assigned the project, I will context group members and customer to build a detailed project.  \\ \hline
            Week 3 & In week3, we got a team, so I know what will I work on during the next three terms. I will create the BoxSand program. This week assignment is to write a problem statement document. I have to write about an outline of the project. Fortunately, the description for box sand program details enough. I added a few detail points which I think that it will be useful. The document is about my idea for this project, so it is too wide to start but there were not many difficulties. I met team members to take about the project. Our team just have a simple understanding of the BoxSand program. We will meet customer next week and built detail Plan for next week is meeting a client to get more information about the program.  \\ \hline
            Week 4 & We met the client this week Thursday. This is the first time to meet a client. The project was a little bit different from my thought. Therefore, it was a good time to figure out the project. A client has a great passion for the project. He also has a clear idea about it. We got detail information about the project during the meeting. The purpose of this project is super attractive. It will be a great tool for OSU students. We shared individual problem statements. We have writing due this week, so we shared the idea and came up with a group document. I got the metrics section to fill out. Writing it already submitted, so everything is going good so far. We have a group paper due next week, so we will meet a person who helps us to create the project. We will get server and coding informational about the project. Our customer is not in the Computer Science major or department, so he will help us to start actual coding.  \\ \hline 
            Week 5 & This week had to write requirements document draft 1. However, the due date was changed so we got more time to work for this assignment. To write better requirements document, we had to get technical information about the project. We met Max who is a BoxSand program director. He is a coder who works with our client. He explained the technical side of the program. The online class is working on one of the boxes and function. That function should cooperate with our whiteboard function. Therefore, we have to clarify which prat for a function should we do and they do. Also, how can we make two functions work together without any problems? We got the foundation to write a paper during a meeting with Max.  \\ \hline 
            Week 6 & We did not have a client meeting this week. It had but it was canceled. I will have a meeting with a client and online group who are already working on other function of BoxSand. I am confusing which parts online class will cover and which parts we will cover. It will be a great opportunity to check this part. Our team will prepare a question to ask them for a meeting. This week assignment is Tech Review writing. It spent more time than my expectation. It needs a lot of resource about software and platforms.  \\ \hline 
            Week 7 & This week we had a meeting with a client. We could not meet other BoxSand team but it was a great opportunity to get information. It was 2hours meeting. They told us some software which we have to search before the next meeting. That software is used to create BoxSand web page. Therefore, we also have to search for it and learn it for projects. This week we have Tech Review Final paper due. I searched for software again. Then, I fixed Tech Review first draft to write a final paper.  \\ \hline

            Week 8 & This week we do not have assignments and meeting. We did not quite do anything. We will have a meeting after Thanksgiving. I have to research the required program during the next two weeks.  \\ \hline 
            Week 9 & Thanksgiving is on this week, so we had a long holiday. Therefore, we got a meeting before we had a long holiday. We will write the design document based on meeting information. Next week is week 10, so there have many assignments due, we will spend most of the time for those.  \\ \hline

            Week & Contents  \\ \hline  
            Week 1 & We missed one team member. We had four members but now we have to finish this project with three members. We met with Max who manages the technical part of the project. He asked us to implement the Whiteboard to  Canvas until next week. We will work that part until next week. Then, we will meet him again next week and report the current process.   \\ \hline
            Week 2 &  We got code last week but, we do not have authority to access code. This week we met the head programmer. He fixed code to allow us to run the code. We can run the program, so group members will meet this week Sunday and work on implementing whiteboard to BoxSand website. We will also take about the pre-draft poster. We have the first client meeting next week. Also, we will start to implement chat to BoxSand website. \\ \hline
            Week 3 & This week had an assignment which is a poster. We met on weekends are finished assignment. We will have a big client meeting. We will meet Online students who are working on this project and the client. That will be a great time to be clear what we have to do. Our project is kind of overlapped with  Online students work. Therefore, it is so difficult to figure out their part and our part. We have to have a client meeting to figure out it. We did not have the opportunity to meet them before, so we always got their idea form client.   \\ \hline
            Week 4 & This week we missed one member, so we have to finish the project with two people. I am a little bit worry about it but we have to finish the project. Since we have fewer members than other groups we will try to do most of part in this term. If we push it to the end, we might not finish the project. We have a  group meeting next week on Monday. I will start to do coding on that day. Also, we found a group to work poster critique together. This assignment is submitted. Rather than team member problem, we are ok. Everything is on the way.    \\ \hline 
            Week 5 &  We have poster critique class this week, so we met with a different group and got advice, so we will progress the poster. We have to figure out how we can put 5 members in one whiteboard. We came up with the idea but before we actually implement it, we have to tell our head programmer. If he said it fine, we can start coding. Next week meeting is Wednesday. If there is a better way to put students on a board, we will get advice and change it. We also talked about the next writing assignment and we will work on this and next weeks.   \\ \hline 
            Week 6 & Our group started to write winter term report. The due date was extended, so we have more time to think about it. We had a meeting this week with the head programmer. Our group will meet and do coding on this Saturday. We aim to write the code which allows the server to get user information who access to BoxSand from Canvas. This is the first step for grouping. We will figure out that part. Then we will work on break out users into a group during next week. We will have three different breaks out session, so we will also take about how to make different groups for each break out session in this week.   \\ \hline
            Week 7 & What we expected to do this week is be friendly with Drupal. We spend most of the time figuring out Drupal this week. This is a new tool for us. Also, it does not have any instructions online. Therefore, we got difficulties to use it. We depending on Drupal Document to developing our project. If it is not enough to solve the problem, we will get help from the head programmer. We had two meetings with him this week. Next week also will probably have one or two meetings to develop the project. Next week plan is doing an assignment and working on chat implementing.   \\ \hline

            Week & Contents  \\ \hline                  
            Week 8 & This week, we are working on bringing virtual class to Drupal server. I found out there is a module to implement it.  However, it does not quite work, so we are struggling with it. Maybe we will keep working on this next week. We planned to meet the head programmer this week. However, we postpone the meeting to next week on Monday. We will open the Drupal server during that meeting. Right now Drupal server does not work properly. Therefore, we are work on localhost. Therefore we have difficulties to share code. We will work on opening the Drupal server and bringing virtual class to Drupal node.   \\ \hline 
            Week 9 & In this week, the head programmer suggested recreating the virtual classroom. Existing virtual classroom has too many bugs and errors, so it is impossible to connect with the Drupal server. Also, another programmer group does not work with this project anymore. It seems like they gave up, so they are no longer in this project. We are working on a virtual classroom until progress report submission, so we will make some progress. It is a big change. It will spend much time, but we will work on until the end of this term to make some difference. Also, we will keep working on it until next term.   \\ \hline
            Week 10 & During this week, I worked on creating the Physic Virtual Classroom webpage. I especially worked on the implementing calendar module and creating lecture contents. On our main page, the calendar should show up and list of lectures should show up there. This week, I was struggling to implement the calendar module. That module was not quite fit with our webpage. Also, even if I downloaded module templets are not shown on the page but, we already figured out that part. Next week is due day of the alpha version of our project. Therefore, we will work on documents and checking functions  \\ \hline

            Week & Contents  \\ \hline  
            Week 1 & This week we contacted the client. However, he was still out of town and he will come back here 17th which is after code freeze. We thought the client will be here during this term, so we are expected to meet him this week. It is one of our problem we encountered now. We will meet the head programmer next week and keep work on it to finish our project until code freeze. We checked draft reports and what we have to change and what we have to add more. Our project is changed a lot, so we checked reports and divided section again. We will work on reports and the project next week. Probably, we can start the project development after meeting with the head programmer, so we will work on the report this week. We will work on the project next week to until code freeze.     \\ \hline
            Week 2 & We figured out timing parts. We worked on timing during this week. Now we just need to clean up a web page. We will do it until code freeze and submit it. We also worked on document diagram. Most of our project is changed, so we had to come up with new diagrams. Also, the entire document contents will be changed. Documentation is due next week, so we will work on document next week.  We hope we can meet the client before code freeze but we can meet him after code freeze. We will meet him on next Wednesday will show and explain our project to get verification. The timing was pretty hard to figure out we worked it on week1 and week2. That part was a difficulty last and this week. However, overall things are going good. \\ \hline
            Week 3 & This week we finally met our client. We showed our Physic Virtual Classroom page and talked about it. He liked overall on our project. We found one error during the demo, so we will work on that error during next week. We will also meet the head programmer and take about bugs and overall webpage. Also, we will work on Expo poster. This week we spend time to finish documents and prepared the next demo with the client. We will fix bugs and meet client again. We did not set the time yet. We did a demo and we got verification sign.    \\ \hline
            Week 4 & This week we mostly focused on the poster. The final poster is due this Friday, so we spent most of the time on it. Next week, we will meet the client to get poster verification. Therefore, we will change our web page, then bring it to show to the client. He wanted us to change some points, so we will work on changing web page during next week and the rest of this week. This week we did not encounter difficulties. One we considered is pictures for the poster. We do not have many pictures to put on the poster. Except that everything was going good.  \\ \hline

            Week 5 & This week is a midterm week, so we do not quite have an improvement. Also, we do not have something to change before the expo. We created a list of whiteboards already, so what we have to do is done. We have a meeting with the client after the expo, so until expo, we will mostly work on documents that the project.  Since we do not have progress, we also do not have difficulty this week too.   \\ \hline 
            Week 6 &  We finished parts which clients want us to change this week, so we wanted to meet the client before expo to make sure those parts. However, the client is available after the expo, so we will have a meeting after the expo. Next week is expo week, so we will check the overall project before expo to make sure, everything is going good. That is our plan for next week. Also, meet with group members and prepare for the expo. We will not change the project before the expo, just make it clean and testing all functions again. Since we finished the project, so we did not have difficulties.   \\ \hline

            Week & Contents  \\ \hline  
            Week 2 &  I'm just assigned to Group 51 and have talked with all my teammates.
            We also have decided how to communicate, but we haven't decided who will take the charge for communication with the client.
            Once all these are done, we will plan how and what we will work.
            First, we may have to judge what is prioritized and necessary for this project. \\ \hline
            Week 3 &  We had two meetings, one is with the client and the other is with our TA.
            We've finished our problem statement, and it looks nice and clean.
            Everything is going really well for now.
            We haven't got any issues so far.
            We have one meeting in the next week with the head programmer of this project, and the meeting is going to be held on every week.
            Also, the meeting with TA is going to be held on every Friday at 4 PM.
            We haven't decided on the meeting with the client, but it seems like we will have the meeting every other week.  \\ \hline
            Week 4 &  We keep in track with teammates with Slack.
            Everything is going great, and we are trying to write the Requirement Document. 
            We met Max, who is the lead programmer of the project, on Tuesday. 
            He explains how the project goes and works in a technical view (like what language we will use or how things are gone so far). 
            We have a meeting with the client in the next week. Until then, finishing Requirement Document is our team's priority.\\ \hline 
            Week 5 & We couldn't meet our TA last week, because there was some connection error between TA and our teammates.
            However, we meet him up today, and we report our weekly progress.
            Everything is going great so far.
            Our plan was meeting with our client and Max (head programmer) this week, but they were so busy.
            So, the meeting delay to the next week. we will meet them on the next Tuesday or Thursday.
            Since our tech review is due on today, our team had a talk about dividing pieces of our project, so we can review these.
            Our team is doing their part really well overall.
            We haven't met any issues or problems yet.
            Our plan for next week is meeting with our client, and now we will talk about starting to develop the actual program.
            Or at least we will see how the whole development environment works.  \\ \hline 
            Week 6 &  In this week, our team had a meeting with our client and the head programmer, Max.
            They explained the overall project structure. It is all about connecting our solution to Canvas(which is the main learning management system used by OSU, now)
            Some of the parts are Ecampus's engineers' job, and developing the whiteboard and connecting to Canvas is going to be our entire goal.
            However, the detailed structure of our project may change as the project progresses.
            Unfortunately, we couldn't have the meeting with TA on this week, since TA canceled it.
            Since our team is working on some documents, for now, we haven't met any problems yet.
            Our next week's plan is going to start reviewing and scanning the whole code of the current structure of Canvas and other containers.
            Also, we need to prepare for the next document that we need to write.  \\ \hline

            Week 7 & Our team has been talking about the design document and the progress report as the next assignments. We haven't started to work on those, but we talked about how we are going to divide the parts up.
            Since we are just working on getting used to the structure of the project, we haven't met any problems.
            We have another meeting with the client in the next week (week 9 and week 10)
            Our plan for the next week is going to talk more and start working on the design document and the progress report.
            For the progress report, it seems like it needs to make a video or slides. So, we need to figure out how we can manage it.  \\ \hline 
            Week 8 &  Our team had a meeting with our head programmer to talk about the next design document. We haven't done much this week, because of Thanksgiving.
            However, we will start working on the design document and the other documents.
            We also need to make an appointment with our client for the last verification. \\ \hline 
            Week 9 & Our team had been working on the design document.
            I've kept contacting the client and the head programmer to make sure everything is up to date.
            Now, we are doing on the final progress report, and we are planning to meet on the weekends for recording the progress.
            Today, we met our TA, and he explained the grades of the requirement document.
            From his feedback, we know what needs to be added for making the document and the project more clear.
            As soon as we finish the progress report, we need to meet our client to get his verification for the whole documents we have done so far.
            We don't have any problem yet, but we are still waiting for the work from the other team (The engineers, who are working for Ecampus)
            After their work is finished, we can get into real implementation.  \\ \hline

            Week & Contents  \\ \hline  
            Week 1 &  Our team had a meeting with our head programmer, Max. Since Winter term has begun, we are about to start actual programming
            Max gave us some assignments, which needs to be done by next Friday. 
            These are just a warming-up, so I think our group is going to be really busy after the week later.
            The only problem we have is that one of our group member, Chris, has quitted the Capstone. 
            So, we need to re-assign each part of the whole project. 
            During the weekends or next week, our group needs to meet again and talk more about how we are going to re-assign our part.
            Other than this issue, our team is doing really well. 
            + TA has reached us out, it seems like we are going to have a weekly meeting with TA on every Wednesday.  \\ \hline
            Week 2 &  Our team had another meeting with Max, and we also had the first meeting with our new TA, Omeed.
            We set our regular meeting every Wednesday at 4:20 pm.
            We had the issue that was a connection problem while we are compiling the server, but the issue has been resolved now.
            Otherwise, everything goes really well. Every teammate is working really hard on this project.
            Dr. Kenneth, who is the main client of our project, had reached us about the big meeting.
            Every engineer, who are related to this project, will meet together and talk more about the scale of the project -- This is the first meeting of all of us.
            For the project, our capstone team will have a meeting on Sunday to develop the integration of a chatting and voice system to the whiteboard.
             \\ \hline
            Week 3 &  This week, we finished our poster and try to get some idea for the elevator pitch.
            We still need to figure out what API we are going to use for the chatting system.
            Since we aren't sure about what chatting systems are needed to be implemented, we still need to talk with the client for the confirmation.
            We don't have any problems so far, but we are currently very busy with other works from other courses.
            Next week or 2 weeks later from this week, the client meeting will be held.  \\ \hline
            Week 4 &  This week, we had a problem.
            One of our team members was left our team. So, now, we have only 2 of people in our group.
            We've talked with Kirsten, TA, and our head programmer.
            Yeongae, who is the other member, and I had a talk about how we are going to handle this problem.
            I've contacted Kevin, and I'm going to make an appointment with him soon.
            Next week, we will start working on the actual project, eventually.  \\ \hline

            Week 5 &We had a poster critique session this week. We met Group 15 for the session.
            We have known that we need to edit something on our poster, so we are going to edit the poster on
            the upcoming week.
            Our task for the project, for now, is that we need to figure out how we can split users into the whiteboard.
            Each whiteboard has 3-4 users (students), and a professor will assign students into each whiteboard.
            or students are assigned randomly into the whiteboards.
            Since I and Yeongae aren't good at a server-side framework or database, we need to research on that.
            Otherwise, everything is going okay in this week.
            Next week, we are going to start working on the progress report and the progress video.\\ \hline 
            Week 6 & We started working on the progressive report.
            Max, who is the head programmer of our project, told us that now we need to find a solution for assigning student into the whiteboards.
            So, I and Yeongae are trying to find a way to solve the issue.
            We've come up a good idea, so we're going to implement the feature to the whiteboard soon.
            Otherwise, we don't have any issues so far.
            We had a regular meeting with our TA and Max on Wednesday.
            Next week, we are going to build the feature and try to finish the progress report.   \\ \hline 
            Week 7 &  This week, we have started the one of CMS, which is Drupal.
            Max recommended it to us for managing whiteboard.
            We are new to use Drupal, so we may need a small amount of time for getting used to it.
            We also are still working on the progress report.
            This Wednesday, we had a meeting with our TA, and we showed our current work.
            No problems this week, and we are planning to start implementing our project with Drupal in the next week.
            We should hurry because we still have a lot of works to do. \\ \hline 
            Week 8 & Our team has started working on the feature, which is the integration between our Website and Drupal.
            Since Drupal has a lot of modules that can help us to implement, but there isn't enough documentation.
            This is one of the biggest issues we have right now. We may have to figure out by ourselves. 
            We are going to meet with Max this weekend, so we hope we can find the solution to it. 
            Next week, we may need to work on the same issue we have now, and we will also start working on fixing bugs.
            As I mentioned earlier, our current website is a little buggy, so we need to fix it in the following week.  \\ \hline 
            Week 9 &  Our team is still working on the feature.
            However, we've slightly changed our plan. Since the code we had for the website was too much buggy and wasn't easy to be solved,
            we have decided to build the whole new website in Drupal. (Technically, we are still thinking what option would be the best for us)
            However, we have the code for the structure and style, this task may be just copying and pasting from the old code.
            Our remote server is running now, so we can start working on this.
            We think this may be better because using Drupal can make the whole process somehow easier.
            Our goal for the project is building a boxsand website that has functionalities, which include a whiteboard and a live session.
            We are working really hard on this right now, and we hope we can get some result very soon.
            These are the problem that we are struggling right now.
            The plan for the next week is that we start working on the final report and presentation.
            Of course, working on our project is going to be our priority. \\ \hline 
            Week 10 & We are still developing the whole new-look site by using Drupal.
            It looks fine now, and it now has some functionalities. 
            Since we are getting used to using Drupal right now, we can speed up working Drupal.
            Of course, there are some limitations to using Drupal.
            First, the passing value between contents, like between the live-session and the whiteboard, is really hard to implement.
            We may figure it out in a different way to solve this problem. 
            Secondly, the website looks great, but we may need to add more functionalities to make the site more intuitive to use.
            I and Yeongae will work on this for the whole weekend.
            This task may be done by the beginning of the next term.
            We don't think we will work on the project during the break.
            However, we will try hard to finish the project as much as we can before the break starts.  \\ \hline

            Week & Contents  \\ \hline  
            Week 1 & We had a break, and we did nothing on the project during the break.
            We had a meeting and decide to work on the document revisions and start working on the last part of our project.
            I and Yeongae met our TA (Omeed), and we talked about what we have done so far.
            This week, we try to finish our requirement document revision and finish our expo poster.
            We have contacted our client (We haven't seen the client from the last fall term).
            Since our goal of the project has been changed somehow, we wanted to confirm the current goal to our client.
            Max has been confirmed our current goal, but we think we should let our client know where we are at now.
            However, the client had to leave the town to go to his conference, and he said he will be back after April 17th.
            Therefore, we just send our current work to the client, and we briefly explained what we have done so far.
            Next week, we will have a meeting with Max on Monday, so we will talk more about how we can finish our project.
            Since our project won't be finished after we finish the project, we need to make a document for the next team, who will work on this project.
            Our part of this project is just a small part of the whole project, so we need to make sure the next team can understand and start working on the project easily after us.
            We made a solid environment and server, so I think it is a good start to integrate other feature from the other team.
            To sum up, we will work on writing the revision during the following weekends, and resume to work on the project.
               \\ \hline
            Week 2 & This week, we had an additional meeting with our TA, omeed.
            This is because there is an issue of cloning our code to grade for the code freeze.
            Since our set-up for the server isn't simple, so it seems to be impossible to clone our code and try to run the code in other machines.
            So, we showed the limitations to our TA, and he said we will have a demo for the grade in the next week.
            Otherwise, it seems the project is almost done, but we would like to add more feature to the site.
            We are now focusing on making the site stable.
            Next week, we will have the meeting our client and show our current work.
            Also, we need the client's verification of the project.
            Therefore, we're also working on writing some documents for our requirements and for the next team who will work on this project.
            \\ \hline
            Week 3 &  We finally met with our client this week.
            We showed our work to our client, and he really liked it.
            The site still has room to improve, so we told him that we will add some features (something small).
            Also, we'll start to work on writing the document, which is for the next project group.
            The client also wants the document to use the website properly.
            He read the requirement and design documents, and he satisfied what we have.
            We'll send him the guiding document as soon as we're done with it.
            Next week, we plan to make a change to our poster.
            And get ready for the EXPO.
            For the implementation, we'll try to find some bugs and fix it, and we'll add some small features if the client requests.   \\ \hline
            Week 4 &  We keep contacting with our client.
            He keeps suggesting the improvement to the website.
            He wants the previous version of managing whiteboards (we made a list of whiteboards, not sending students automatically at every 1min),
            because he thinks opening the whiteboard while taking the whole lecture is better and efficient to students.
            Therefore, we'll work on this in a few weeks.
            We will also meet with our client and Max (the head programmer) after the week of Expo.
            Otherwise, we haven't done anything big on our project after the code freeze.
            Next week, we are probably going to get the feedback of our poster, so we can print that out.
              \\ \hline 
            Week 5 &  We finally submitted our final version of the poster.
            We're getting ready to attend the Expo.
            From the last week, the client asked us to make the list of the whiteboard, and we did it somehow.
            I can't tell it's done, because there's a problem.
            AWW, a web whiteboard, API we are using, is changing their link to each specific whiteboard every week (this is just a guess).
            Last time, I choose the particular link to put in our whiteboard, but it has been changed into a random link.
            In this case, this isn't our issue, so we may need to talk with AWW team to solve this issue.
            This may end up with paying whiteboards from AWW.
            Other than that, we don't have any issues so far, and we'll be prepared for the Expo. \\ \hline 
            Week 6 & No much on progress in this week.
            We've talked with our client and we think we better to meet and talk about the future changes.
            The time will be on 21st, but the time of the meeting may be changed.
            Now, we will focus on writing the guide documentation. 
            It will before the client and the next project team.
            Next week, the Expo is due, so we have to prepare for it.   \\ \hline
